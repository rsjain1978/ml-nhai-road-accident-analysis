**Sailient Features of Classifier are:**

 - Model accuracy is 69%+
 - Top 5 features for Accident Type are as follows:
   - Fatal
     - Most of accidents had no fatalities)
   - Grevious
   - Minor Accident 
     - Most accidents are minor in nature)	 
   - Nature of Accident 
     - Most accidents are caused either by Overturning or as Head-on Collisions)
   - Day of Accident 
     - Occurences of accidents are spread across all days of month, although they tend to happen more at the start of the month

	 
 - On doing data visualization following areas are most prone to accidents:
	 - 126 KM on Right Hand Side
	 - 115 KM on Right Hand Side
	 - 126 KM on Left Hand Side
	 - 109 KM on Right Hand Side
	 - Around 86 KM
